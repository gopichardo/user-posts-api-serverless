# Task
Implement a User-Post Dashboard that fetches user and post data, combines them, and displays the information in an interactive table.

## To-Do List (in order of priority)
1. Set up the HTML structure for the dashboard
2. Fetch user data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
3. Fetch post data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
4. Combine the data to create a list of users with their post counts
5. Create a table to display: user name, email, company name, and post count
6. Implement a search feature to filter users by name or email
7. Add a button to sort users by post count (descending/ascending)
8. Display a loading indicator while data is being fetched
9. Implement basic error handling for API calls

## Nice-to-Haves (if time permits)
- Add a feature to expand a user's row to show titles of their posts
- Implement simple styling for better presentation
- Display the total number of users and posts

## Resources
- JSONPlaceholder API:
  - Users: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
  - Posts: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- MDN Web Docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript

## Evaluation Criteria
Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1. Correct data fetching and combination
2. Effective DOM manipulation
3. Implementation of interactive features (search and sort)
4. Code organization and clarity
5. JavaScript best practices
6. Problem-solving approach

## Time Management
- 5 minutes: Setup and planning
- 20 minutes: Implementation of core features
- 5 minutes: Refinement or implementation of nice-to-haves

Remember, the goal is to demonstrate your coding process, problem-solving skills, and ability to work with related datasets. Focus on writing clean, functional code for the core requirements.

Good luck!
